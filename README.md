    <strong>saanp.vi</strong>
</p>

I developed this simple Snake Game using the SDL2 library in C.
I was inspired by a video on the [CS50](https://www.youtube.com/@cs50) YouTube channel, which demonstrated [2D Games in C using SDL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFLa3ln16w0).
The name **`saanp.vi`** (with 'saanp' meaning 'snake') playfully describes the snake-like behavior of my friends, while 'vi' refers to the Vim keybindings used for controls.

## Project setup
